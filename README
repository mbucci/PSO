Implements PSO with four different topologies and three different algorithms depending on what the user specifies.


Input:

	Basic input:

		java PSO <topology type> <num. particles> <num. iterations> <test function> <num. dimensions>

	For topology type, the user can choose between four different topologies, with four different inputs:

		gl => Global Topology
		ri => Ring Topology
		vn => Von Neumann Topology
		ra => Random Toplogy

	For the test function, the user has a choice between three different options:

		rok => Rosenbrok functoin
		ack => Ackley function
		ras => Rastrigin function

	Example input: 

		java PSO ri 50 50000 rok 30


Output: 

	The output will report the best value for each iteration.

	Example:

	Iteration #1 Best value: 1.7976931348623157E308
	                    |
	                    |
	                    |
	                    v
	Iteration #50000 Best value: 13.924688050691932
